## Summary

Define an optional enhancement of the CARv1 stream that allows a Gateway server to provide
additional metadata about the CARv1 response. Introduce a new content type that allows the client
and the server to signal or negotiate the inclusion of extra metadata.

## Motivation

SPARK is a Filecoin Station module that measures the reputation of Storage Providers by periodically
retrieving a random CID. Since both SPs and SPARK nodes are permissionless, and Proof of Retrieval
is an unsolved problem, we need a way to verify that a SPARK node retrieved the given CID from the
given SP. To enable that, we need the Trustless Gateway serving the retrieval request to include a
retrieval attestation after the entire response was sent to the client.

Aside from this specific use case, the IPFS Ecosystem at large has no reliable
mechanism to signal that a CAR file transmission over HTTP completed successfully.

We need this in order to be able to use CARs as a way of serving streaming
responses for queries. One way of solving this problem is to append an extra block at the end of the
CAR stream with information that clients can use to check whether all CAR blocks have been received.

## Detailed design

CAR content type
([`application/vnd.ipld.car`](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.ipld.car))
already supports optional parameters like `version` and `order`, which allows
HTTP client to opt-in via `Accept` header and Gateway to indicate via
`Content-Type` header which CAR flavor is returned with the response.

The proposed solution introduces a new parameter for the CAR content type in HTTP requests
and responses: `meta`.

The `meta` parameter allows clients to request the server to include additional metadata about the CAR along with the response body.

The value of this parameter includes both the location where the metadata is given (e.g. `eof`) as well as the type of data received (e.g. `json`) separated by a `+`, to give a value such as `meta=eof+json`

When the location parameter is set to `eof`, which is currently the only supported value, the server SHOULD respond with <Response body as CARv1 stream> <0x00 byte> <Metadata>.

The only supported value for the data type parameter is `json`. This signifies that the metadata MUST be a JSON object.

This parameter MUST only be used with CAR `version=1`.

When the parameter is not set or does not equal `eof+json`, the server SHOULD not add any extra blocks to the response, neither the 0x00 byte nor any metadata.

This results in a example content type of `application/vnd.ipld.car;version=1;meta=eof+json`

See [CAR `meta` (content type parameter)](/http-gateways/trustless-gateway/#car-meta-content-type-parameter)
in Trustless Gateway specification for more details.

## Design rationale

The proposal introduces a minimal change allowing Gateways and retrieval clients to explicitly opt
into receiving additional metadata block at the end of the CAR response stream.

The metadata block is designed to be very flexible and able to support new use-cases that may arise
in the future.

### User benefit

- Clients of trustless gateways can use the fields from the metadata as an attestation that they
performed the retrieval from the given server.

- For example, the metadata block could include a `car_bytes` field, the byte length of the CAR stream (excluding the metadata block). This would allow clients to verify whether they received all CAR
bytes, which provides a backward-compatible solution for the [CARv1 streaming problem](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/332) until new CAR version is introduced.

- As another example, the metadata object includes the `error` field, allowing the server to pass back additional information about why the response is an error, such as why the CAR stream was incomplete.

- In the SPARK use case, retrieval clients would like to prove they have retrieved an entire file from a specific retrieval provder that has implemented the trustless gateway spec. The additional metadata block allows checksums and signatures to be passed along with the data, allowing the retrieval client to create a proof of correct retrieval. For SPARK, the metadata properties object SHOULD include the following fields:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "car_bytes": {
      "description": "The total byte length of the CAR stream (excluding the 0x00 byte and the metadata block)",
      "type": "integer"
    },
    "b3checksum": {
      "description": "A Blake3 hash (checksum) of the CAR stream (excluding the 0x00 byte and the metadata block)",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "content_path": {
      "description": "The url path in the request as executed by the gateway",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "dag_params": {
      "description": "A map with DAG params like dag-scope, entity-bytes from [IPIP-402](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0402/)",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "dag-scope": {
          "description": "See [IPIP-402](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0402/) for the definition",
          "type": "string"
        },
        "entity-bytes": {
          "description": "See [IPIP-402](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0402/) for the definition",
          "type": "string"
        }
      },
      "required": []
    },
    "car_params": {
      "description": "A map with CAR content type params like order and dups from [IPIP-412](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0412/)",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "order": {
          "description": "See [IPIP-412](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0412/) for the definition.",
          "type": "string"
        },
        "dups": {
          "description": "See [IPIP-412](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0412/) for the definition.",
          "type": "string"
        }
      },
      "required": []
    },
    "required": ["car_bytes", "b3checksum", "content_path", "dag_params", "car_params"]
  }
}
```
The metadata `sig` field SHOULD also be populated, returning a signature, using the server's Ed2559 identity, over the metadata properties object.

### Compatibility

The new feature requires clients to explicitly ask the server to include the extra block via `Accept` header,
therefore the change is fully backwards-compatible for all existing gateway clients.

Gateways receiving requests for the CAR content type can ignore the `meta` parameter they don't
support and return back a response with one of the CAR content types they support. This makes the
proposed change backwards-compatible for existing gateways too.


### Security

The proposed specification change does not introduce any negative security implications.

### Alternatives

#### HTTP Trailers

Instead of adding a new content type argument, we were considering sending the additional metadata
in HTTP response trailers. Unfortunately, HTTP trailers are not widely supported by the ecosystem.
Nginx proxy module discards them, [browser `Fetch API` does not allow JS clients to access trailer
headers](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues/14703), neither does the Rust `reqwest` client.

#### New Content-Type

We could introduce a new content type that is not CARv3, but a thin envelope
around CARv1 with purpose of streaming over HTTP (e.g. `Content-Type:
application/vnd.ipld.car-stream`).

It would have three fields:
- `car-stream-header` (optional DAG-CBOR)
- `car` (same as `application/vnd.ipld.car;version=1`)
- `car-stream-end` (optional DAG-CBOR)

This will be enough to append DAG-CBOR  manifest at the end of the stream. It
would be effectively the same CAR byte stream, but with different
`Content-Type`.

Upside of this solution:

- does not require registering new codec, or mixing data plane with control
  plane, no sniffing the last DAG-CBOR block

Downsides of this solution:

- maintenance cost, requires duplicating of all CAR-related tests and features
- ecosystem opportunity cost, in creating new content type, we increase
  cognitive overhead for everyone working with IPFS over HTTP
- no backward-compatible interop with existing tools and gateways that only
  speak `application/vnd.ipld.car`
- distracts us away from working on things like large blocks and CARv3

#### Create CARv3

We could admit we've clearly hit limitation of what we can do with HTTP and CARv1 and CARv2 and stop abusing existing CARv1 by mixing data plane with control plane.

Spend energy on creating CARv3 that solves the problems from "Motivation" section and more:
- optional index or key-value metadata before or after data
- native truncation detection and standardized error handling and passing during streaming
- support for things like [Large Blocks](https://discuss.ipfs.tech/t/supporting-large-ipld-blocks/15093/)

TODO: link to some public  artifact about CARv3

## Test fixtures

TBD

Using one CID, request the CAR data using various combinations of content type parameters.
