## Summary

Define an optional enhancement of the CARv1 stream that allows a Gateway server to provide
additional metadata about the CARv1 response. Introduce a new content type that allows the client
and the server to signal or negotiate the inclusion of extra metadata.

## Motivation

SPARK is a Filecoin Station module that measures the reputation of Storage Providers by periodically
retrieving a random CID. Since both SPs and SPARK nodes are permissionless, and Proof of Retrieval
is an unsolved problem, we need a way to verify that a SPARK node retrieved the given CID from the
given SP. To enable that, we need the Trustless Gateway serving the retrieval request to include a
retrieval attestation after the entire response was sent to the client.

Aside from this specific use case, the IPFS Ecosystem at large has no reliable
mechanism to signal that a CAR file transmission over HTTP completed successfully.

However, we need this in order to be able to use CARs as a way of serving streaming
responses for queries. One way of solving this problem is to append an extra block at the end of the
CAR stream with information that clients can use to check whether all CAR blocks have been received.

## Detailed design

CAR content type
([`application/vnd.ipld.car`](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.ipld.car))
already supports optional parameters like `version` and `order`, which allows
HTTP client to opt-in via `Accept` header and Gateway to indicate via
`Content-Type` header which CAR flavor is returned with the response.

The proposed solution introduces a new parameter for the CAR content type in HTTP requests
and responses: `meta`.

When the CAR content type parameter `meta` is set to `eof`, the Gateway will write one additional CAR
block with metadata to the response, after it sent all CAR blocks.

The metadata format is DAG-CBOR and open to extension, allowing standardized
userland experimentation similar to the Extensible Data field from IPNS V2.

See [CAR `meta` (content type parameter)](/http-gateways/trustless-gateway/#car-meta-content-type-parameter)
in Trustless Gateway specification for more details.

## Design rationale

The proposal introduces a minimal change allowing Gateways and retrieval clients to explicitly opt
into receiving additional metadata block at the end of the CAR response stream.

The metadata block is designed to be very flexible and able to support new use-cases that may arise
in the future.

### User benefit

- Clients of trustless gateways can use the fields from the metadata as an attestation that they
performed the retrieval from the given server.

- The `len` field in the metadata block allows clients to verify whether they received all CAR
bytes, which provides a backward-compatible solution for the [CARv1 streaming problem](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/332) until new CAR version is introduced.

### Compatibility

The new feature requires clients to explicitly ask the server to include the extra block via `Accept` header,
therefore the change is fully backwards-compatible for all existing gateway clients.

Gateways receiving requests for the CAR content type can ignore the `meta` parameter they don't
support and return back a response with one of the CAR content types they support. This makes the
proposed change backwards-compatible for existing gateways too.


### Security

The proposed specification change does not introduce any negative security implications.

### Alternatives

#### HTTP Trailers

Instead of adding a new content type argument, we were considering sending the additional metadata
in HTTP response trailers. Unfortunately, HTTP trailers are not widely supported by the ecosystem.
Nginx proxy module discards them, [browser `Fetch API` does not allow JS clients to access trailer
headers](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues/14703), neither does the Rust `reqwest` client.

#### New Content-Type

We could introduce new `Content-Type: application/vnd.ipld.car-stream` and
create a specification of its wire format that wraps CARv1 and includes
additional DAG-CBOR  manifest at the end. It would be effectively the same CAR
byte stream, but with different `Content-Type`.

Upside of this solution:

- does not require registering new codec, or sniffing  the last DAG-CBOR block

Downsides of this solution:

- maintenance cost, requires duplicating of all CAR-related tests and features
- ecosystem opportunity cost, in creating new content type, we increase
  cognitive overhead for everyone working with IPFS over HTTP
- no backward-compatible interop with existing tools and gateways that only
  speak `application/vnd.ipld.car`
- distracts us away from working on things like large blocks and CARv3

## Test fixtures

TBD

Using one CID, request the CAR data using various combinations of content type parameters.
